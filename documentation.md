<h1>Scheduling Statistically Documentation</h1>

<p>welcome to the documentation for Scheduling Statistically! Our project helps users with time management through statistical analysis of a user's behavior</p>

<h2>Frontend</h2>

<h2>Backend</h2>

<h3>Database</h3>
For our database, we used Airtable, a relatively low barrier to entry database, paired with the Airtable API in order to access, modify, and create records. For the abstraction, we used two objects: ScheduledEvent and User.
<h4>ScheduledEvent</h4>
<h4>User</h4>
